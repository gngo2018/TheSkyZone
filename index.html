                <h3>About The Sky Zone</h3>
                <p>
                        It all started with a big dream from a small dreamer. 
                        There are always those who want to open simple retail businesses selling either sporting equipment, clothes, things that smell nice, etc. 
                        But this dreamer wanted to do something big. He wanted to take a leap into something different. 
                        Something that would make his friends shell shocked at the next high school reunion. 
                        The dreamer took a leap of faith into the skies, and thus The Sky Zone was born.

                <h3>Fun Facts of the Day</h3>
                <p>
                    Did you know that...

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Airplanes are designed to withstand lightning strikes. Every once per 1000 hours of flight time, an airplane is struck by lightning. However, lightning has not brought down an airplane since 1963.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>The small hole at the bottom of windows were made to regulate cabin pressure. The windows are also made up of three acrylic panels which acts as a fail safe system if anything were to happen outside of the aircraft.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>While in the air, the aircraft can actually fly for a certain distance without the engines being engaged. A Boeing 747 can glide up to two miles for every 1,000 feet they are above the ground.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Why Not Join Today?</h1>
                    <p>
                            Honestly, who wouldn’t want to join today? Especially if it only takes a few moments of your day! Signing up is very simple. There are two options:</p>
                        <ol style="font-size: 155%;">
                            <li>Sign up via our online website. We will be back in contact with you via email or phone call (whichever is convenient for you) about personal details</li>
                        <br/>
                           <li> Give us a call! We get it, online isn’t for everyone. Our call center hours are from 6:00am-6:00pm Mountain Time. The customer service representatives are more than happy to assist you!</li>
                         </ol>   
                            
                        <p>So what is the catch you might be asking. That catch is a big fat nothing! The only charges that you will see are the services you choose. No membership, subscription, social security, etc. needed! The Sky Zone was made for the people, by the people.
